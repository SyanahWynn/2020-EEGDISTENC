# Alpha modulation in younger and older adults during distracted encoding
Here you will find the experimental design and analysis script used in the aformentioned published paper. The scripts were not created to be widely used by others, so may not be user-friendly. The scripts were altered by deleting redundancy and remove participant-specific steps. In this way, readability and generalizability has increased.

# Experimental Design
The experimental design was created and used in MATLAB in conbination with the Psychophysics Toolbox extensions (v3.0.14). Input files are needed to input the stimuli, which are not added here.

# Data Analysis script
Here you will find the analysis script used to process the data for subsequent statistical tests. This version is an adjusted version of the script, which is altered after the publication to improve readability. Start with the "Main_analyses.m" script, all the other scripts will be called from this one.
